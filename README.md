If your project involves **TestNG** (a testing framework for Java), your `README.md` should reflect how to set up, run, and write tests with **TestNG**. Below is a tailored `README.md` template for a project using TestNG:

```markdown
# Project Title

Brief description of the project, what it does, and the purpose of the test cases. This could include the application being tested, the types of tests performed, and the testing approach.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using Maven or Gradle (depending on your build tool):
   - For Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn install
     ```
   - For Gradle:
     ```bash
     gradle build
     ```

3. **Add TestNG as a dependency** (if not already included):
   - For Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml`:
     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
       <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
       <version>7.x.x</version> <!-- Use the latest stable version -->
       <scope>test</scope>
     </dependency>
     ```

   - For Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:
     ```groovy
     dependencies {
       testImplementation 'org.testng:testng:7.x.x' // Use the latest stable version
     }
     ```

## Running Tests

Once your project is set up, you can run the tests with the following commands:

- **Using Maven**:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

- **Using Gradle**:
  ```bash
  gradle test
  ```

If you want to run tests from a specific class or method, you can do this by specifying the test class or method:

- For Maven:
  ```bash
  mvn -Dtest=TestClassName test
  ```
  or for a specific method:
  ```bash
  mvn -Dtest=TestClassName#testMethodName test
  ```

- For Gradle:
  ```bash
  gradle test --tests "TestClassName"
  ```

## TestNG Configuration

TestNG is configured via the `testng.xml` file. This file defines how TestNG should run the tests, including grouping tests, setting parameters, and configuring listeners.

Here is a sample `testng.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<suite name="MySuite">
  <test name="MyTest">
    <parameter name="url" value="http://example.com" />
    <classes>
      <class name="com.yourpackage.TestClass" />
    </classes>
  </test>
</suite>
```

- **Suite**: Defines the overall test suite.
- **Test**: Defines individual test sets, where you can configure parameters, classes, and more.
- **Classes**: Contains the test classes that will be executed.

## Writing Tests

TestNG tests are written as Java methods and annotated with TestNG annotations.

### Example:

```java
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.BeforeMethod;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class CalculatorTest {

    private Calculator calculator;

    @BeforeMethod
    public void setUp() {
        calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        int result = calculator.add(2, 3);
        Assert.assertEquals(result, 5, "Addition result should be 5");
    }

    @Test
    public void testSubtraction() {
        int result = calculator.subtract(5, 3);
        Assert.assertEquals(result, 2, "Subtraction result should be 2");
    }
}
```

### Key Annotations:
- `@Test`: Marks a method as a test method.
- `@BeforeMethod`: Runs before each test method.
- `@AfterMethod`: Runs after each test method.
- `@BeforeClass`: Runs once before the first test method in the class.
- `@AfterClass`: Runs once after all test methods in the class.

### Asserting Results:
TestNG uses assertions (e.g., `Assert.assertEquals()`, `Assert.assertTrue()`) to verify expected behavior.
